CodeSnippetHub is a Flask-based web application designed to streamline the management and sharing of code snippets. At the core of this project, we utilize Flask alongside SQLAlchemy to facilitate the backend server and database management functionalities. The application connects to a SQLite database for persistent storage and employs middleware for efficient JSON parsing. With a focus on user accessibility, CodeSnippetApi provides routes for users to easily manage their snippets and personal information. It runs on port 5000, making it readily accessible for development and testing purposes.
